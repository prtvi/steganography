# Steganography for Images

## Steganography
It is the technique of hiding digital data such as audio/image/video within an ordinary, simple non-secret file such as audio/image/video.

## About the Project
This is a simple implementation of Image Steganography using the **LSB** (Least Significant Bit) technique. Implemented using MATLAB. This project includes two implementations:

- [img2img](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/tree/master/img2img): to hide an image inside of another image.
- [txt2img](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/tree/master/txt2img): to hide plain text inside of an image.

## File Description
- img2img/
  - [stegano.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/img2img/stegano.m): Run this file to hide an image into another. Make sure the foreground and background images are of the same dimensions (*foreground.png* and *message.png* added for reference). This file generates a new image file as an output.
  - [decrypt.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/img2img/decrypt.m): Run this file to obtain hidden image from the image generated by *stegano.m*.

- txt2img/
  - [stegano.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/stegano.m): Run this file to hide plain text into an image (*cover.png* added for reference). This file generates a new image file as an output.
  - [decrypt.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/decrypt.m): Run this file to extract hidden text from the image generated by *stegano.m*.
  - [b2d.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/b2d.m) and [d2b.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/d2b.m): (helper files) Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary converters respectively as required for code.
  - [get_char.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/get_char.m): (helper file) Produces a char from a stream of 8 bits.
  - [put_to_img.m](https://github.com/prithviie/steganography/blob/master/txt2img/put_to_img.m): (helper file) Modifies the last bit of a given integer by replacing with the bit from a given stream of bits.
